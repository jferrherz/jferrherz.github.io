Thank you for dropping by. My name is Jacobo, and I am an economist and sociologist currently working on distributional and environmental applications of input-output models for the study of climate change in the Department of Land Morphology at the [Technical University of Madrid](https://portalcientifico.upm.es/es/ipublic/researcher/336709). I hold a PhD in economics from The New School for Social Research in New York and am a PhD candidate in civil systems engineering at the Technical University of Madrid. My research touches on various topics, from political economy to climate change, but is fundamentally driven by my interest in studying the relationship between structural change and the living standards of the majority of the population. Methodologically, I favor input-output analysis, Bayesian econometrics, and household surveys. I have a passion for the classics of political economy, the system of national accounts, and the R programming language.

My professional background includes teaching and consultancy, though most of my experience has been in programming-intensive roles that involve working with diverse datasets for policy-oriented analysis. I have previously worked as a PhD trainee within the Distributional Wealth Accounts team in the Sector Accounts and Fiscal Statistics Section of the European Central Bank, as well as at the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) producing flash multidimensional vulnerability/poverty indices for LDCs during the Covid-19 pandemic. During my PhD at The New School, I taught several courses, including graduate econometrics as a teaching assistant and the political economy of populism as a teaching fellow.

At this moment, I have three main lines of applied work:
  * **Statistical regularities in production structures**.
  * **Distributional input-output models** applied to environmental and inflation research.
  * **Inequality, Living standards, and essential sectors**.
