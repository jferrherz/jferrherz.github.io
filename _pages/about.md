I am an economist and researcher at the \href{https://portalcientifico.upm.es/es/ipublic/researcher/336709}{Technical University of Madrid} working on distributional and environmental applications of input-output models related to carbon footprint estimation and analysis. I hold an economics Ph.D from the New School for Social Research, New York.
