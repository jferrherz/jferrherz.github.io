Welcome!
======
I am an economist and researcher at the [Technical University of Madrid](https://portalcientifico.upm.es/es/ipublic/researcher/336709) working on distributional and environmental applications of input-output models related to carbon footprint estimation and analysis. I hold an economics Ph.D from the New School for Social Research, New York.
