Thank you for dropping by! My name is Jacobo Ferrer Hern√°ndez, and I am an economist and sociologist. I am currently working on distributional and environmental applications of input-output models for the study of climate change in the Department of Land Morphology of the [Technical University of Madrid](https://portalcientifico.upm.es/es/ipublic/researcher/336709). I hold an economics Ph.D from The New School for Social Research, New York.
