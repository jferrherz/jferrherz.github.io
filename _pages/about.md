I am an economist and sociologist currently working on distributional and environmental applications of input-output models for the study of climate change in the Department of Land Morphology at the [Technical University of Madrid](https://portalcientifico.upm.es/es/ipublic/researcher/336709). I hold a PhD in economics from The New School for Social Research, New York, and I am a PhD candidate in civil systems engineering at the Technical University of Madrid. My research spans several topics, from political economy to climate change, but it is fundamentally motivated by the desire to study the relationship between structural change and the living standards of the vast majority of the population. From a methodological standpoint, I favor input-output analysis, Bayesian econometrics, and household surveys. I have a passion for the classics of political economy, the system of national accounts, and the R programming language.
