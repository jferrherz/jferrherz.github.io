I am an economist and sociologist currently working on distributional and environmental applications of input-output models for the study of climate change in the Department of Land Morphology at the [Technical University of Madrid](https://portalcientifico.upm.es/es/ipublic/researcher/336709). I hold a PhD in economics from The New School for Social Research, New York, and I am a PhD candidate in civil systems engineering at the Technical University of Madrid. My research spans several topics, from political economy to climate change, but it is fundamentally motivated by the desire to study the relationship between structural change and the living standards of the vast majority of the population. From a methodological standpoint, I favor input-output analysis, Bayesian econometrics, and household surveys. I have a passion for the classics of political economy, the system of national accounts, and the R programming language.

Previously, I worked as PhD trainee in the Distributional Wealth Accounts team in the Sector Accounts and Fiscal Statistics Section of the European Central Bank. My main responsibilities included regular production, code maintenance and development, bilateral contact with NCBs, and the development of an improved extrapolation method for the time series exploiting the information from the Consumer Expectations Survey. Before that, I worked at the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) producing flash multidimensional vulnerability/poverty indices of LDCs during the Covid-19 pandemic to evaluate the socio-economic impact of lockdowns and other containment measures. These two experiences were crucial to developing a close familiarity with the management and analysis of large datasets, particularly household surveys.

At this moment, I have three main lines of work:
  * **Statistical regularities in production structures**.
  * **Distributional input-output models** applied to environmental and inflation research.
  * **Living standards and essential sectors weight in decarbonization planning**.
