My job market paper *Local drivers and global suppliers of GHG emissions from the city of Madrid, 2010-2021* can be found below; if you have trouble opening the document, please follow this [link](http://jacobo-ferrer.github.io/files/ferrer_jmp.pdf). A presentation of the paper can be found in the following [slides](http://jacobo-ferrer.github.io/files/2024_ferrer_jmp_slides.pdf) and in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vE6tcUcb54M&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwebinars.shaio.es%2F&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE). A repository containing the *R* code used to produce the estimation, as well as the *Quarto* code for the paper is stored in my [github](https://github.com/jacobo-ferrer/carbon_footprint_madrid_city) site.
